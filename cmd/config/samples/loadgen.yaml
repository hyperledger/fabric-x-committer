# The limit on the number of TXs is applied at block granularity. I.e., more TXs might be created than expected
# if a block overshot.
# The load generator stops when both requirements are met, i.e., one of them might overshoot.
# For the orderer adapter, the blocks limit is ignored for broadcasting as we don't track submitted blocks.
# For adapters that use concurrent submitters, we cannot enforce exact limits.
# The sidecar and coordinator adapters are sequential, so they don't have these issues.
